[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/robisys/mybsp1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robisys/mybsp1)

To run the test command we will need to install the jshint node module from NPM:

    npm install jshint --save-dev

Now you can run the test command locally by typing npm test in your terminal.

If you do it, you can see the test fails. But we are not introducing you to Travis so
you can run tests manually, that's Travis's job! Let's see how Travis can run tests automatically!
